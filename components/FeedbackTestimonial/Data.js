      "We were more than delighted with our website, designed, built and hosted by Web & Prosper. John was easy to deal with, professional and the final result delivered, exceeded our expectations. The increase in business was immediate, thanks to the far more professional image our website now has and the ease of the new e commerce interface. John's attention to detail is superb, a perfectionist in every way and he takes as much interest and care in the design, build and hosting of your website as if it were his own business. I can highly recommend him. , .",
